# CPU-Emulator

A Simple CPU emulator that can perform Programs

## Files

*   `CPU.py`: Contains the CPU emulation logic.
*   `ProgramCompiler.py`: Likely handles the compilation or interpretation of programs.
*   `UI.py`: Suggests a user interface component for the emulator.
*   `main.py`: The entry point for the application.
*   `program.txt`: A file that likely contains programs to be executed by the emulator.
*   `__pycache__/`: Directory for Python bytecode cache.

## Usage

To run the emulator, execute `main.py`. The emulator will then likely load and execute programs from `program.txt` using the components defined in `CPU.py`, `ProgramCompiler.py`, and `UI.py`.

## Notes

The exact functionality and interaction between the files are not detailed. The `__pycache__` directory is a standard Python optimization and does not require user interaction.
